# ccl2-athero-stata
This repository contains the software code used in Stata 16.1 to perform meta-analyses on mouse studies of CCL2/CCR2 
inhibition in atherosclerosis, the results of which are presented in the research output 
*Pharmacological targeting of the CCL2/CCR2 axis for atheroprotection: a meta-analysis of preclinical studies.
 
The dataset for the code is available in the online version of aforementioned publication under the following DOI: # DOI #.

# Fig2 #
This code has been used to generate the results that are displayed in Fig. 2 of the manuscript, entitled:

"Forest plot of the effects of CCL2/CCR2 inhibition versus control (Hedges’ g) on atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic arch and root, the carotid, and the femoral artery."


# Fig3 #
This code has been used to generate the results that are displayed in Fig. 3 of the manuscript, entitled:

"Forest plot of the effects of CCL2/CCR2 inhibition versus control (Hedges’ g) on macrophage accumulation, collagen deposition, and smooth muscle content in plaques of the aortic arch or root."

# Fig4 #
This code has been used to generate the results that are displayed in Fig. 4 of the manuscript, entitled:

"Subgroup analyses regarding the effects of CCL2/CCR2 inhibition versus control (Hedges’ g) on aortic plaque burden and macrophage accumulation by various study characteristics."

Bear in mind that the different extensions to the file names ( e.g. lesion stage) refer to the respective subgroup analysis.

NOTE: While the provided code will yield a forest plot displaying the results of the subgroup analysis, it will not return the same format as used in the publication.

This code has been used to generate the results that are displayed in Fig. 5 of the manuscript, entitled
"Meta-regression analysis of the effects of CCL2/CCR2 inhibition versus control (Hedges’ g) on macrophage accumulation on the effects of the intervention on atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic arch and root."
